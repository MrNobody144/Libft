# Libft

- A **42KL** project

- A recreation of basic **C** function that exists in common **C** libraries

- All of the functions can be used by linking the library libft in your Makefile

 - Example: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Llibft -lft
  - -L refers to the directory the library is in
  - -l refers to the actual library's name without the, 'lib' prefix and '.a' postfix
